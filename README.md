# Machine Learning: Stroke Prediction Model
Please refer to the [report](https://github.com/hiamdebsi/Project_3-Visualize_Me_Captain/blob/main/Project%203%20-%20Report.pdf) and [presentation](https://github.com/hiamdebsi/Project_3-Visualize_Me_Captain/blob/main/Project%203%20-%20Presentation.pdf) for a thorough explanation of this project. Below you will find the analysis steps and links to the relevant folders and files.

## Motivation

## Project Objective

## Methods
### Data Sources Used:
  * [Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

### Final Production Database: 
 * MongoDB Atlas

### Libraries Used: 
  * Matplotlib.pyplot
  * Pandas
  * Seaborn
  * Pymongo
  * Sklearn
  * Pickle

## [Data Engineering](https://github.com/hiamdebsi/ML-Stroke-Prediction/tree/main/Data%20Engineering)
* Insert Image of Flow *
* Link jupyter notebook * 

## Model Data [Implementation and Optimization](https://github.com/hiamdebsi/ML-Stroke-Prediction/blob/main/Data%20Model%20Implementation/Final_Optimized_Model_RM-Copy1.ipynb) 

 * Evaluated 4 models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN),Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.
 * Used the following [optimization methods](link to report) to improve models:
   * SMOTE
   * GridSearchCV Optimizer
   * Scaled Data
   * Stratifying Data
* We then saved the final optimized model as a pkl file in order to deploy on Heroku. Details of the Flask Application as well as the Heroku Deployment will be [linked right here.](https://github.com/SherryKennedy/Stroke_Prediction_Model)
